## About

The SettleMint EAS SDK provides a lightweight wrapper for the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), enabling developers to easily create, manage, and verify attestations within their applications. It simplifies the process of working with EAS by handling contract interactions, schema management, and The Graph integration, while ensuring proper integration with the SettleMint platform. This allows developers to quickly implement document verification, identity attestation, and other EAS-based features without manual setup.
