## About

The SettleMint TheGraph SDK provides a seamless way to interact with TheGraph APIs for blockchain data indexing and querying. It enables you to easily create and manage subgraphs, define schemas, and query indexed blockchain data using GraphQL from your SettleMint-powered blockchain networks.

The SDK offers a type-safe interface for all TheGraph operations, with comprehensive error handling and validation. It integrates smoothly with modern TypeScript applications while providing a simple and intuitive developer experience.

For detailed information about using TheGraph with the SettleMint platform, check out our  [official documentation](https://console.settlemint.com/documentation/docs/using-platform/middleware/#the-graph-middleware).
